Isotope end-member splitting using NEON data and remote sensing analysis
In this study, we use stable isotope data measured in National Ecology Observation Network (NEON) sites to quantify the partitioning of winter and summer precipitation into runoff and ET. The objectives of this study are to 1) calculate precipitation routing for NEON sites across the U.S. and 2) identify relationships between partitioning fractions and watershed-scale landscape and climate characteristics inferred from geospatial datasets. The variables tested against partitioning fractions are as follows: coefficient of variation of CCI, standard deviation of CCI, difference between peak and late-season CCI, peak CCI, minimum CCI, the ratio of summer precipitation to annual precipitation, mean annual precipitation, forest height, EVI amplitude, EVI area-under-the-curve, and EVI minimum.
