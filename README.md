Isotope end-member splitting using NEON data and remote sensing analysis
In this study, we use stable isotope data measured in National Ecology Observation Network (NEON) sites to quantify the partitioning of winter and summer precipitation into runoff and ET. The objectives of this study are to 1) calculate precipitation routing for NEON sites across the U.S. and 2) identify relationships between partitioning fractions and watershed-scale landscape and climate characteristics inferred from geospatial datasets. The variables tested against partitioning fractions are as follows: watershed area, mean annual temperature, elevation, percent of canopy above 5, 10, and 20 meters, mean canopy height, canopy height standard deviation, the ratio of ET to precipitation, the ratio of summer precipitation to annual precipitation, mean annual precipitation, EVI amplitude, EVI area-under-the-curve, EVI minimum, growing season length, and the ratio of EVI area to EVI minimum.
